Unlike the title of the archive it is not the original PTS BASIC but is instead
a slightly more modern implementation. More like RT11's BASIC-11.
It includes features, such as string handling which were missing from othe original
PTS BASIC; and other features such as use of assembly language extensions have been
significantly altered.

This is the starting point for the PTSBASIC-TK, a standalone PDP-11 papertape basic
with Tektronix 4014 extensions.
